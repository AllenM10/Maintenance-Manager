A simple Java program for keeping track of all of your regular maintenance activities! Feed the program the date you last performed an action (such as changing an HVAC filter), give it the length of time between maintenance sessions (90 days for the above example), and it will tell you when it is time to do it again! The program will reset upon the passing of the due date for every maintenance item, meaning you only have to enter the dates and intervals once, and the program will work forever.

NOTES:

-Running the program creates a maintenance log .csv file that must remain in the same directory as the .java file.

-This program is intended to be loaded, viewed, used, and closed in one session, rather than left open for days on end.

-Upon reopening the program, any due dates which are past the current date will have their interval added to them, resulting in the next due date for that maintenance item being shown.

-Please reach out with any problems or suggestions for improved or additional functionality! Have a great day. UwU
